## Stochastic Simulator FLS

### Stochastic Simulator for recovery based on p80

This streamlit app allows to simulate using mathematicals models the effect of decreasing the variability of P80, in the recovery of cupper.

#### Sensitivity Analysis
It allows to perform sensitivity analysis, for different mean values of P80, given the minimun and maximum values of standard deviation.

#### Economic Evaluation
Compares two scenarios, the first one is the base case and the second is the one with an improvement in P80 standard deviation, this quantifies the impact of generating this changes, in terms of recovery, tons of copper, and income.
